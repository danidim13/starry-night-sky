Based on **Meteor Shower** A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/loktar00/pen/Jdwug](https://codepen.io/loktar00/pen/Jdwug).

Just a random starry night and a meteor shower. The terrain is generated using midpoint displacement.

Also took some inspiration from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUBAi9xQ2X4) by Daniel Shiffman
